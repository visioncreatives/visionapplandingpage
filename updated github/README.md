# Vision — Landing Page

> **September 2026 homepage review:** the local redesign is on `codex/homepage-redesign`. See [review/REVIEW.md](review/REVIEW.md) for current preview instructions, CTA verification, changed files and checks. The original setup notes below predate this redesign; their placeholder URLs and deployment steps are historical instructions, not approval to publish.

The public marketing landing page for **Vision**, a modern creative marketplace where people can find creatives that match their vision — for content, branding, events, styling, photography, design, and more.

Built with **Vite + React + Tailwind CSS** (JavaScript, no TypeScript). No backend, no database, no auth — just a clean, mobile-first landing page ready for Vercel.

## 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Dev server opens at **http://localhost:5173**.

To verify the production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## 🔗 Replace the App URL

Open **`src/App.jsx`** and change line 7:

```js
const APP_URL = "https://app.joinvision.app"
```

Replace with your Lovable / PWA URL, e.g. `https://your-app.lovable.app`. Every "Explore Creatives", "Become a Creative", and "Open Vision App" CTA uses this constant.

## 📦 Push to GitHub

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Vision landing page"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vision-landing.git
git push -u origin main
```
